# layout.flex

Successor to [layout.attrs](https://github.com/benjaminapetersen/layout.attrs).
A set of small, composable flex utilities for building layouts. Inspired by and conceptually
similar to [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/polymer/layout-attrs.html) layout & [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/layout/grid) but without the Material
Design component.  This project is intended to be generic flex.

More to come, in the meantime see the README from layout.attrs above, the same functionality
has been preserved, but now both classes & attributes on DOM nodes is supported.
